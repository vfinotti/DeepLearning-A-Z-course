# Deep Learning A-Z course files

Hello! This repository is used to store some exercises and projects I did while doing the [Deep Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/) course on Udemy (I highly recommend it, if you are looking for a good starting point). It not only goes straight to the important points, but also gives a list of references of where to find more details in case you need to go deeper.
